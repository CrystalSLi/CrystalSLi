There's something wrongw ith me, there's something defective, i'm unlovable, not good enough, I'm fallin short, I have failed somehow.

                I started doing therapy last year. I went through a couple of hard situations. One being my dad got involved in a Pig Butchering scam
                and lost all of his money and sadly mine too. I went through a pretty long drawn out breakup. Realized I was queer. Moved to a new city.
                Alot of things culminated into a lot of sleep less nights and mind spirals. I had some friends (A and J) who were doing therapy and suggested
                I try it out. The process was just as hard as everybody said, but out of the hole came the brightness that is Tyler Hakomori. Below, are a couple
                of quotes that Tyler has taught me. I hope if anybody else needed to hear some of these things they'll help you like they helped me.
